    question: "How does the 'Amazonian Ritual' work?",
    answer: "It targets the root cause of chronic nail issues: a lack of protective probiotics. By restoring your natural 'Microbiome Shield', your body is able to fight off fungus from the inside out and prevent its return."
  },
  {
    question: "How long before I see results?",
    answer: "Most users notice a difference in nail texture and clarity within the first 14 days, with full restoration usually occurring after 60-90 days of consistent daily ritual."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this safe for sensitive skin?",
    answer: "Yes. Our solution uses natural, probiotic-based ingredients designed to work with your body's biology rather than using harsh chemicals that strip your skin's natural defenses."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the 60-day guarantee?",
    answer: "If you aren't absolutely thrilled with your results, we offer a 60-day iron-clad money-back guarantee. No questions asked. We stand behind our breakthrough 100%."
